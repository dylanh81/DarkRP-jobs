If you want these jobs in your server do the following:

1. Go to your server directory computer or hosted i don't know what you have.
2. Goto gamemodes\darkrp\gamemode\config
3. And then you just drag and drop "jobrelated.lua" Into the folder. 
     and the jobs should be in the server!
4. You could also copy them from github and paste them into the file 
   (But you should just stick with the drag and drop idea)
